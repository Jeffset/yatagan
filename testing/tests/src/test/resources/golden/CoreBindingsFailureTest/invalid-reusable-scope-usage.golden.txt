error: @Reusable scope is for bindings only and doesn't make sense on a @Component declaration and thus not supported here. Did you mean to make the component with no dedicated scope?
Encountered:
  here: graph for root-component test.MyComponent

error: @Reusable scope is used along with other scopes which doesn't make much sense. Other scopes can be safely removed without changing the behavior.
