# Module lang-api

Contains interface definitions for a **language model** abstraction layer.

Models language constructs in a universal way (for Java and Kotlin).
The API is in no way general purpose; it's designed specifically for DL and thus cuts some corners, that DL doesn't 
 require.

The type system is Java oriented. Though some info on Kotlin specific entities, 
 such as companion objects and properties, is available.
